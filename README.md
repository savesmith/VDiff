# Athena Compare Method Versions


This extension utilizes the pattern of editing a method by copying it and changing its version.

Example:
    getUsers20200531 -> getUsers20221206

It takes a file with those two functions and seperates them out so you can use vs code's diff comparator to review your changes.
